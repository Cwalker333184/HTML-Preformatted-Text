# HTML-Preformatted-Text

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to develop a deeper understanding of HTML elements, focusing on the use of pre-formatted text and its practical applications in web design.

### Key Concepts:
- **HTML Elements**: Understanding basic HTML elements like `<h1>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and the `<pre>` tag.
- **Pre-formatted Text**: The `<pre>` tag is used to display text in a way that preserves whitespace and line breaks. This is useful for displaying code snippets or any content that requires exact formatting.
  
## Instructions

This assignment involves creating an HTML-only webpage that includes specific elements, and deploying it to GitHub Pages. The focus is on correctly using basic HTML elements and the `<pre>` tag.

### Part 1: Setting up the Project

1. **Create a New Repository**:
   - On GitHub, create a new repository named  `HTML-Preformatted-Text`.
   - Initialize this repository with a `README.md` file.
   - Clone your new repository to your local machine.

2. **Create the Webpage**:
   - In your repository, create an `index.html` file.

### Part 2: Webpage Development

Develop an HTML webpage with the following specifications:

1. **Main Title**:
   - Include an `<h1>` tag for the main title of the page.

2. **Main Element**:
   - Include a `<main>` element containing two `<section>` elements.

3. **Section 1: Pre-formatted Text**:
   - Write a small description about what the `<pre>` element is and why itâ€™s used.
   - Use the `<pre>` tag to display this information in a pre-formatted style.

4. **Section 2: JavaScript Code**:
   - Display a small snippet of JavaScript code in a regular `<p>` tag.
   - Then, display the same JavaScript code inside a `<pre>` tag to highlight the difference in formatting.
